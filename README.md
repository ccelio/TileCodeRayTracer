**TileCodeRayTracer**

Christopher Celio, 2008 May


----------

This is my first ever C++ program, written for a class project in
parallelization techniques targeting the Tilera TILE64 many-core processor. 

You can see an example output from my ray tracer here:

----------

I make no promises about this code - the quality, the correctness, or even if it compiles anymore. It was originally set up inside Eclipse which auto-generated the build directories and makefiles. Caveat emptor.

Here are some of the links that helped me learn both C++ and raytracing:
